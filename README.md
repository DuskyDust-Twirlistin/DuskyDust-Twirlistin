- 👋 Hi, I’m @DuskyDust-Twirlistin, a Chinese senior high school student.(for now)
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and C++. I want to make my own game, a MLP(G4) fan game, by them(mostly by C++). It will cost few years, especially when I have to make a game engine first.
- The game will be started after I go to college, exactly speaking, a year later.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and try my best to make my own game engine. Maybe you can see it in the following years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project, if you are a brony(or whatever) and is interested in this game and engine.
## - 📫 How to reach me
well, so far there are several ways to reach me.
